                Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values,
                beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and
                directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners
                can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience
                that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational.

            <p class="para1">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills
                deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through
                imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. As
                cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation,
                formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom.[2]
                Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi (right) in the Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements published in 1607
                Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe.[3] The city of
                Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle
                of Ancient Greece. </p>

        <div class="secpara2 sec1">
            <p class="para1">The Aztecs also had a well-developed theory about education, which has an equivalent word
                in Nahuatl called tlacahuapahualiztli. It means "the art of raising or educating a person",[6] or "the
                art of strengthening or bringing up men".[7] This was a broad conceptualization of education, which
                prescribed that it begins at home, supported by formal schooling, and reinforced by community living.
                Historians cite that formal education was mandatory for everyone regardless of social class and
                gender.[8] There was also the word neixtlamachiliztli, which is "the act of giving wisdom to the
                face."[7] </p>

        <div class="secpara3 sec1">
            <p class="para1">The European Age of Empires saw European ideas of education in philosophy, religion, arts
                and sciences spread out across the globe. Missionaries and scholars also brought back new ideas from
                other civilizations â€“ as with the Jesuit China missions who played a significant role in the
                transmission of knowledge, science, and culture between China and Europe, translating works from Europe
                like Euclid's Elements for Chinese scholars and the thoughts of Confucius for European audiences. The
                Enlightenment saw the emergence of a more secular educational outlook in Europe.</p>
